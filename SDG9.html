    <h1 class="lol"> SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure </h1>
</div>
<div class="cont">
<p class="para">Goal 9 seeks to build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization and foster innovation. Economies with a diversified industrial sector and strong infrastructure sustained less damage and are experiencing faster recovery. In 2021, global manufacturing rebounded from the pandemic, although the recovery remains incomplete and uneven.

  Higher-technology industries performed better and recovered faster, providing a strong example of how important technological innovation is to achieving Goal 9. </p>

<h2 class="head"> Targets</h2>
<p class="eradicate">
    1)Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all. <br>
    2) Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, significantly raise industryâ€™s share of employment and gross domestic product, in line with national circumstances, and double its share in least developed countries. <br>
    3) Increase the access of small-scale industrial and other enterprises, in particular in developing countries, to financial services, including affordable credit, and their integration into value chains and markets. <br> 
    4)By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities. <br>
    5) Enhance scientific research, upgrade the technological capabilities of industrial sectors in all countries, in particular developing countries, including, by 2030, encouraging innovation and substantially increasing the number of research and development workers per 1 million people and public and private research and development spending. <br>
    6)Support domestic technology development, research and innovation in developing countries, including by ensuring a conducive policy environment for, inter alia, industrial diversification and value addition to commodities. <br>
    7)Facilitate sustainable and resilient infrastructure development in developing countries through enhanced financial, technological and technical support to African countries, least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States 18. <br>

<h3 class="lolee">Solutions</h3>
<p class="breef"> 1)Using greener materials to construct the next generation of infrastructure, like poly carbon fibre which is cheap, durable and made from recycled plactics. <br><br>
  2)Reducing the amount of unsustainable infrastructure like skyscrapers and promoting eco friendly houses which use less concrete and bricks, made from recycled plastics or from recycled wood
  promoting futuristic cities. <br><br> 
  3)Increasing the green cover of cities to reduce their carbo  footprint as well as reduce the ground temperature of those cities. <br><br>
