</div>
<div class="cont">
<p class="para">  Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being at all ages is essential to sustainable development. Currently, the world is facing a global health crisis unlike any other â€” COVID-19 is spreading human suffering, destabilizing the global economy and upending the lives of billions of people around the globe.
    Major strides had been made in millions of people's health before the pandemic. Significant progress has been made in extending life expectancy and decreasing some of the leading causes of infant and maternal death. But more work is required to entirely eradicate a variety of diseases and deal with a variety of ongoing and new health problems. Significant progress can be made in saving the lives of millions of 
people by concentrating on improving sanitation and hygiene, funding health systems more effectively, and expanding access to doctors.

<h2 class="head"> How Can We Ensure Healthy Lives For all ?</h2>
<p class="eradicate">
    1) Building healthy societies and enhancing population health in the face of COVID-19 <br>
2) A well-care system that prioritises maintaining people's health <br>
3) Crucial Actions Such as early detection <br>
4) Enforcement on Regulations <br>
5) Laws for Intervention by the Government <br>

<h3 class="lolee">In Brief </h3>
<p class="breef"> 1) The COVID-19 pandemic has already made it clear that those who are most affected by it are members of underprivileged groups and marginalised communities. The health status of many populations both within and between nations has been negatively impacted by pervasive inequality. In addition to the devastation of health systems and the direct and indirect health effects of COVID-19, it is anticipated 
    that population mobility restrictions and lockdowns implemented to combat the pandemic will have enormous economic and social effects. <br> <br>    
    2) Primary prevention is a strategy that places an emphasis on immunisations, changing lifestyle behaviours, and controlling harmful substances. It can effectively prevent several diseases. There has been success with preventative measures. Countries have successfully used dietary change promotion, health professional training, and public awareness initiatives to combat obesity (for example, limits on unhealthy foods, taxes and nutrition labelling).
    While some promise can be shown in other strategies, like workplace health promotion programmes, 
    their effectiveness still has to be proven. <br><br> 
    3) It makes sense to describe early detection's operations and range in order to have a productive conversation about it. Pre-symptomatic screening and therapy that begins as soon as the first symptoms are identified are examples of early detection. Programs may look for a particular condition (such HIV/AIDS or breast cancer) or they may be more general. <br><br>
    4)  Setting ranges of normality, prohibiting or discouraging overdiagnosis, and lowering provider incentives to overtreat patients or comply with patients' improper requests will all require government regulation and action. Value-based care and capitation models have shown some success in various nations, including the US.
    Governments may also need to step in to de-risk the innovation paradigm so that private capital sources are more willing to invest in the creation of novel treatments with tested business models as well as new detection technologies. <br><br>
    5) Government Intervention is needed to regulate the medicinal costs. <br><br>
