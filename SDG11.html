    <h1 class="lol"> SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities </h1>
</div>
<div class="cont">
<p class="para">Goal 11 is about making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Today, more than half the world’s population live in cities. By 2050, an estimated 7 out of 10 people will likely live in urban areas. Cities are drivers of economic growth and contribute more than 80 per cent of global GDP.

  However, they also account for more than 70 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. If well-planned and managed, urban development can be sustainable and can generate inclusive prosperity. The deep inequalities exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and other cascading crises highlight the importance of sustainable urban development. Strengthening the preparedness and resilience of cities is crucial in responding to future crises. </p>

<h2 class="head"> Targets</h2>
<p class="eradicate">
   1)By 2030, ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services and upgrade slums. <br>

   6)By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management. <br>

<h3 class="lolee">Solutions </h3>
<p class="breef"> 1)Shifting from petrol vehicles to electric vehicles to reduce emmissions inside the city
  providing universal education and healthcare to the citizens. <br><br>
  2)Using the renewable resources only to the extent of their regenerative capability. <br><br>
3)Shifting from polluting energy to green energy, since the producttion of green energy doesnt emit greenhouse gasses. <br><br>
