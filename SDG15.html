    <h1 class="lol"> SDG 15: Life On Land</h1>
</div>
<div class="cont">
<p class="para">Goal 15 is about conserving life on land. It is to protect and restore terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and stop biodiversity loss. Healthy ecosystems and the biological diversity they support are a source of food, water, medicine, shelter and other material goods. They also provide ecosystem services – the cleaning of air and water – which sustain life and increase resiliency in the face of mounting pressures.

  Nevertheless, human activities have profoundly altered most terrestrial ecosystems: around 40,000 species are documented to be at risk of extinction over the coming decades, 10 million hectares of forest (an area the size of Iceland) are being destroyed each year, and more than half of key biodiversity areas remain unprotected.</p>

<h2 class="head"> Targets</h2>
<p class="eradicate">
    1)By 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world. <br>
    2)By 2030, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development. <br>
    3)Promote fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and promote appropriate access to such resources, as internationally agreed. <br>

<h3 class="lolee">Solutions</h3>
<p class="breef"> 1)Increasing the green cover of earth <br><br>
  2)Declaring more forest area as protected zones <br><br>
  3)Making bridges between the roadways that cut through the forest area to aid the natural pathways of migration for animals. <br><br>
