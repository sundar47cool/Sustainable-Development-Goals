    <h1 class="lol"> SDG 14:Life Below Water</h1>
</div>
<div class="cont">
<p class="para">Goal 14 is about conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas and marine resources. Healthy oceans and seas are essential to human existence and life on Earth. They cover 70 per cent of the planet and provide food, energy and water. The ocean absorbs around one quarter of the world’s annual carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, thereby mitigating climate change and alleviating its impacts.

  It is essential to conserve and sustainably use them. Yet, human activity is endangering the oceans and seas – the planet’s largest ecosystem – and affecting the livelihoods of billions of people. </p>

 <br>
<h2 class="head"> How can we protect them?</h2>
<p class="eradicate">
    1)By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution. <br>
    2)By 2030, increase the economic benefits to Small Island developing States and least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism. <br>
    3) Increase scientific knowledge, develop research capacity and transfer marine technology, taking into account the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission Criteria and Guidelines on the Transfer of Marine Technology, in order to improve ocean health and to enhance the contribution of marine biodiversity to the development of developing countries, in particular small island developing States and least developed countries. <br>
</p> <hr>
<h3 class="lolee">Solutions</h3>
<p class="breef"> 1)regulating the growing sub aquatic tourism industry, which is harmful to the ecosystem. <br><br>
2) Banning the fishing of category 3 near extinct fishes. <br><br>
3)Making such offences punishable with heavy fines and jail time.
