    <h1 class="lol"> SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation</h1>
</div>
<div class="cont">
<p class="para">Access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene is the most basic human need for health and well-being. Billions of people will lack access to these basic services in 2030 unless progress quadruples. Demand for water is rising owing to rapid population growth, urbanization and increasing water needs from agriculture, industry, and energy sectors.

  Decades of misuse, poor management, overextraction of groundwater and contamination of freshwater supplies have exacerbated water stress. In addition, countries are facing growing challenges linked to degraded water-related ecosystems, water scarcity caused by climate change, underinvestment in water and sanitation and insufficient cooperation on transboundary waters.
  
  To reach universal access to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene by 2030, the current rates of progress would need to increase fourfold. Achieving these targets would save 829,000 people annually, who die from diseases directly attributable to unsafe water, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene practices. </p>

 <br>
<h2 class="head"> Targets to be achieved </h2>
<p class="eradicate">
  1)By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all <br>
  2)By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations. <br>
  3) By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally. <br>
  4)By 2030, substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity. <br>
  5)By 2030, implement integrated water resources management at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate. <br>
  6) By 2030, expand international cooperation and capacity-building support to developing countries in water- and sanitation-related activities and programmes, including water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse technologies. <br>
  7) Support and strengthen the participation of local communities in improving water and sanitation management. <br>
</p> <hr>
<h3 class="lolee">Solutions</h3>
<p class="breef">1)Establishing desalination plants in coastal regions <br> <br>
  2)Cleaning up rivers and creating fresh water <br> <br>
  3) Reservoir near major towns and cities <br>  <br>
  4) rain water harvesting and using underground water at a rate less than the regenerative capacity of the water level. <br> <br>
