</div>
<div class="cont">
<p class="para">If done right, agriculture, forestry and fisheries can provide nutritious food for all and generate decent incomes, while supporting people-centred rural development and protecting the environment. Right now, our soils, freshwater, oceans, forests and biodiversity are being rapidly degraded. Climate change is putting even more pressure on the resources we depend on, increasing risks associated with disasters such as droughts and floods. Many rural women and men can no longer make ends meet on their land, forcing them to migrate to cities in search of opportunities. A profound change of the global food 
and agriculture system is needed if we are to nourish today’s 815 million hungry and the additional 2 billion people expected by 2050. </p>

<h2 class="head"> How can we achieve the goal Zero Hunger ?</h2>
<p class="eradicate">
    1)Break the Cycle of Conflict <br> 
    2)Help Rural Farmers Connect to Markets <br>
    3) Increase Sustainability and Build Resilience to Climate Change <br>
    4) Reduce Food Waste <br>
    5) Encourage a sustainable variety of crops.

<h3 class="lolee">In Brief </h3>
<p class="breef">1) With almost 60% of the world’s hungriest people living in conflict affected zones, conflict is the greatest challenge to Zero Hunger. Conflict and hunger create a vicious cycle. When war erupts, instability forces people to find illicit and sometimes violent means of acquiring their necessities. In this unstable period where access to food is fought over, the risk of social unrest heightens. <br> <br>

    2)The cruelest irony of hunger is its disproportionate impact on small-scale farmers—the very people who grow food for a living. Small-scale farmers make up the majority of people living in poverty. Their economic losses come from lack of access to production inputs like proper storage, fertilizer and farming equipment as well as constant challenges from climate extremes. <br> <br>
    
    3) Climate extremes are one of the main drivers of severe hunger. We have entered a ‘new normal’ where consecutive and extreme weather events – like droughts, flooding, hurricanes and cyclones – decimate farming and drive displacement. As a result, communities constantly operate in recovery mode: Diminished economies, destroyed infrastructure and disrupted access to food significantly reduce people’s capacity to rebuild their livelihoods and prepare for the next imminent disaster. <br> <br>
    
    4) The world produces more than enough food to feed everyone, and yet 828 million people still go to bed hungry each night. In high-income countries, 40% of food is wasted because people buy more food than they can consume. In low-income countries, where the vast majority of the world’s hungriest people live, most food loss occurs during the early stages of growth, harvest and storage. <br> <br>
     
    5) Today, across the globe, four crops (rice, wheat, corn and soy) represent 60% of all calories consumed. To address the challenges of climate change, food availability and access, we need to help farmers explore and identify a more diverse range of crops.</p>
