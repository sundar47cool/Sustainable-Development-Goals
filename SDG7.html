    <h1 class="lol"> SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy</h1>
</div>
<div class="cont">
<p class="para">Goal 7 is about ensuring access to clean and affordable energy, which is key to the development of agriculture, business, communications, education, healthcare and transportation. The lack of access to energy hinders economic and human development.

  Latest data suggest that the world continues to advance towards sustainable energy targets. Nevertheless, the current pace of progress is insufficient to achieve Goal 7 by 2030. Huge disparities in access to modern sustainable energy persist.
  
  Rising commodity, energy and shipping prices have increased the cost of producing and transporting solar photovoltaics modules, wind turbines and biofuels worldwide, adding uncertainty to a development trajectory that is already far below Goal 7 ambitions. Achieving energy and climate goals will require continued policy support and a massive mobilization of public and private capital for clean and renewable energy, especially in developing countries. </p>

<h2 class="head">Targets </h2>
<p class="eradicate">
   1) By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services. <br>
   2)By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. <br>
   3)By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency. <br>
   4)By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology. <br>
   5)By 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States, and land-locked developing countries, in accordance with their respective programmes of support. <br>

<h3 class="lolee">Solutions </h3>
<p class="breef">1) Using the earths thermal energy by creating thermal power plants near high energy usage areas.
  <br><br>
  2) Subsidizing solar panels for each house roof. <br><br>
  3) Generating electricity near every major high usage area so that less energy is lost in transit. <br><br>
