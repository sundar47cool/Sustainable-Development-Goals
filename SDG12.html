<div class="cont">
<p class="para">Goal 12 is about ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns, which is key to sustain the livelihoods of current and future generations.

  Unsustainable patterns of consumption and production are root causes of the triple planetary crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. These crises, and related environmental degradation, threaten human well-being and achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.
  
  Governments and all citizens should work together to improve resource efficiency, reduce waste and pollution, and shape a new circular economy. </p>
