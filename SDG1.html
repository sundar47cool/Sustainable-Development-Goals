<p class="para">The 2030 Agenda acknowledges that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the
 greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development. <br><br />
 The first Sustainable Development Goal aims to “End poverty in all its forms everywhere”. Its seven associated targets aims,
  among others, to eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty,
and implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.

<h3 class="lolee">In Brief </h3>
<p class="breef"> 1) Whether guaranteeing access to justice, promoting norms of equality and respect, en- suring access to quality essential services, or supporting citizens' organization and voice, governments can play an important role in the empowerment of poor. <br> <br>
  2) Statistics show that if all children were educated with basic reading and writing skills, the world's poverty could be reduced by 15% a year.
  3) Reducing violence avoids the considerable direct costs and allows for the reallocation of resources to more productive sectors such as health and education, which yield compounding benefits to society over time. The economic benefits accrued from reducing violence can be thought of as a peace dividend. <br> <br>
  4) Ending Hunger can end poverty. <br> <br>
  5) Raising the minimum wage might be helpful to overcome inflation and hence it is useful to eradicate poverty among labourers.</p>
